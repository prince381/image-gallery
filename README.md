# Lightbox Image Gallery with vanilla JavaScript

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this simple but awesome vanilla JavaScript project of mine.

## Description

This is a simple front-end web development project that entails a lightbox image gallery with filter created with only HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Anime.js. The goal of this project was to implement simple but elegant lightbox image swipper without depending on any third party JavaScript library.

## Demo

A demonstration of the application is displayed below in the gif. You can also check it out at [lightbox-gallery.netlify.app](https://lightbox-gallery.netlify.app)
